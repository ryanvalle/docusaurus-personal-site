        By profession, I'm a software developer, mainly building web sites and web apps. I've got full stack experience. Currently, I work as a lead software engineer for an e-commerce site.

        So far, I've ran 19 half marathons (13.1 miles), and 6 marathons (26.2 miles). I'm either crazy or just love running. There'll be some random running content around here.

        Travel, photography, sometimes video production, and music are other things I enjoy. I might share some of that content around here too - that's partly what the blog is for.

        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>My name is Ryan and welcome to my site. If you're looking to learn more about what I do professionally, then check out the resum√© page, or go find me on LinkedIn. Being transparent, I'm not actively searching for work so there's a good chance I'll be unresponsive to recruiters.</p>
        <p>For me, this site is just a place for me to experiment, mess around, and try new things in web and software development that may be interesting to me. For example, I learned about <a href="https://docusaurus.io" target="_blank">Docusuarus</a>, and that became a drive to build this out. It was something new, but offered a lot default functionality to let me get to the fun stuff.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I also want to get back into blogging as a way to share stuff I know with the world. Sure, there's Medium and other online platforms for that, but that doesnt help me with experimenting with web development, so here I am setting something up independently. I have this goal to build this out as a place where I can dump knowledge for the bots to find, to populate search engine indexes, and allow random strangers to find and consume that content to learn. One can dream.</p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting, and enjoy whatever random things you might find here.</p>
